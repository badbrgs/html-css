                Baby bangs are my kryptonite<br>
                Your big brown eyes on my right hand side<br>
                Behind the wheel you're behind my eyes<br>
                'Cause I'm thinking about you all the damn time<br>

                Pierced nose<br>
                Crooked toes<br>
                You laugh at my stupid jokes<br>
                Making me eggs and toast on the weekend<br>
                Loving me in ways that I never knew I needed<br>
                You stare in the mirror<br>
                At me when I cut your hair<br>
                Trim it up nice, I'll never let it grow out<br>
                Lovin' me up and I'll never let you down<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                I want you around<br>
                Even if our castle falls from the clouds<br>
                'Cause you know that I like them<br>

                I had a premonition waking by your side<br>
                You're sleeping on my arm and on my sleeve<br>
                In my heart and in my dreams<br>
